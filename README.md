# rootingMAD


This program roots the concept trees and the tree replicates using the MAD algorithm as described chapter 5.2.3 in Köllner (2021). Please note: to run this program you need to provide your own trees and add the appropriate information to the main.py

Tria et al. (2017) introduced the minimal ancestor deviation (MAD) method for tree rooting as an alternative method to mindpoint and outgroup rooting. The original source code from Tria et al. (2017) can be found under: https://www.mikrobio.uni-kiel.de/de/ag-dagan/ressourcen. The code used in Jäger (2019) can be accessed under: https://github.com/gerhardJaeger/competititiveRooting.
